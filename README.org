This package (i.e org-auto-tangle) is a very simple emacs package that
allows you to automatically tangle org files on save. This is done by
adding the option ~#+auto_tangle: t~ in your org file.

The tangling process happens asynchronously so it will not block your
emacs session.

* USAGE 

Simply require the package in you emacs init.

#+begin_src 
(require 'org-auto-tangle)
#+end_src

You can turn this behaviour on and off though the
~org-auto-tangle-tangle-on-save~  variable. If the value is non nil it
is on it will try to automatically tangle your org files if they
contain a non nil value for the ~#+auto_tangle:~ option.
